        <h1>Welcome to Map Mania Version 2</h1>
        <p id="intro">
            For this game you will have to guess where my markers are on the map. This is very easy to do. You move around the map looking for my favorite locations. 
            If you get stuck and do not know where to look there will be hints that you can click on to see where the locations might be. You will be scored on how 
            many you get right. Good luck and have fun!
        </p>
        <p>
            *If you give up there is a cheat button below the map. Click it and it will reveal all the locations.
